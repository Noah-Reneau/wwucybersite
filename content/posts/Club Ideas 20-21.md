Greetings everyone,

The cybersecurity club is looking forward to creating interesting and fun events during the school year. We need your help to decide which topics are of the utmost interest. Please fill out the following club idea poll and choose the top 3 topics to have events centered around. You can even write your own topic down as well:

By popular demand, the first event series will consist of a professional development workshop. These events will take place October 21st and 29th. Details will be sent out soon.


Hope everyone is having a great year,
