Our visit to Tempered Networks in Seattle will take place the afternoon of Thursday, November 7th.  We will depart Seattle 
at approximately noon, spend two hours with Tempered, and eat dinner in Seattle before returning to Bellingham 
(don't worry about the cost- dinner is on us!)

We will be arranging carpools to Seattle.  If you need to skip lunch and return to Bellingham immediately after our visit 
to Tempered, please mention this in the sign-up form and we will make it happen.

If we have too many sign-ups, we'll randomly select a group and invite everyone else to join a waitlist.

Note that by signing up with the form below, you're promising that you WILL attend the trip on November 7th.

Sign-ups close on Sunday, October 19th. Send any questions to cscwwu@gmail.com
