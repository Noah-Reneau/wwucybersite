Join us on March 3rd as we take a full day trip to Seattle!

We will spend the morning with Microsoft in Redmond, touring their Cybercrimes Unit and the Security Operations Center.  In the afternoon, we will cross Lake Washington to visit ExtraHop, a network security startup located in downtown Seattle.  In between, we will eat lunch on the Eastside, generously paid for by Western's Computer Science department.

We will depart from campus at approximately 8am, and return at approximately 5:30pm.

Send questions or comments to cscwwu@gmail.com

Signups will close on February 13th.

By signing up below, you are committing to go on the trip.  Individuals who fail to be present, without notifying club leadership, may not be invited to future company visits.
